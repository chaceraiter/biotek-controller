# Summary: Community Level Physiological Profiling

- CLPP adapts Biolog plate technology to mixed microbial communities, using tetrazolium dye reduction to quantify carbon source utilization over time.
- Plates used include GN/GP (95 substrates) and EcoPlate (31 substrates), enabling metabolic fingerprints of communities.
- Two key metrics are defined: AMR (Average Metabolic Response) and CMD (Community Metabolic Diversity), both derived from OD measurements versus control wells.
- Protocol highlights: prepare a dilution targeting ~10^5 cfu per 100 uL, inoculate 100 uL per well, incubate at 25 C, and read OD at 590 nm on a schedule (t=0 plus multiple time points over a week).
- Data analysis involves plotting AMR and CMD over time to compare communities; materials and sterile handling steps are provided.
