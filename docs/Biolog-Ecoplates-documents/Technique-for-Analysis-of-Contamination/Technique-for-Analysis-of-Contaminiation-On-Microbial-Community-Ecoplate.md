Microbial Communities.

Abstract: The application of Biolog EcoPlate(TM) for community-level physiological profiling of soils is
well documented; however, the functional diversity of aquatic bacterial communities has been hardly
studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Biolog EcoPlate(TM)
technique and evaluate comparatively the applied endpoints, for the characterisation of the effects of
metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) on freshwater microbial communities. Microcosm experiments
were run to assess the effect of nano ZnO and nano TiO2 in freshwater at 0.8-100 mg/L concentration
range. The average well colour development, substrate average well colour development, substrate
richness, Shannon index and evenness, Simpson index, McIntosh index and Gini coefficient were
determined to quantify the metabolic capabilities and functional diversity. Comprehensive analysis
of the experimental data demonstrated that short-term exposure to TiO2 and ZnO NPs affected the
metabolic activity at different extent and through different mechanisms of action. TiO2 NPs displayed
lower impact on the metabolic profile showing up to 30% inhibition. However, the inhibitory effect
of ZnO NPs reached 99% with clearly concentration-dependent responses. This study demonstrated
that the McIntosh and Gini coefficients were well applicable and sensitive diversity indices. The
parallel use of general metabolic capabilities and functional diversity indices may improve the output
information of the ecological studies on microbial communities.

Microbial diversity in aquatic and terrestrial environments is a key component of
ecosystem functioning, consequently contamination of these environmental matrices poses
potential threats to the structure and function of the respective ecosystems [1-3]. Nano
titanium dioxide (nTiO2 ) and nano zinc oxide (nZnO) belong to the anthropogenic engineered metal oxide nanoparticles (MO-ENPs), the production and use of which was
estimated to increase exponentially during the years owing to their extensive application
in medicine, electronics, cosmetic and textile industry [4,5], but recently also in modern
agriculture [6]. The likeliness of nTiO2 and nZnO release into the environment is higher
than that of other ENPs, given their high global production and consumption volume
among the MONPs [7] and the several transport pathways. Some studies have reported the
presence of anthropogenic ENPs, particularly TiO2 , in streams [8], wastewater treatment
plants [9,10] and lakes [11]. Once released into the aquatic environment, MONPs have
been reported to be involved in homo- and hetero-aggregation followed by precipitation or
sedimentation and accumulation [12-15].
Furthermore, in the presence of ligands (Cl- , SO4 2- , NO3- etc.), ENPs may form
complexes and adsorb onto natural organic matter (NOM) [15]. Therefore, the stability of
ENPs in the aquatic ecosystems is influenced by environmental factors and the properties
of NPs [16], which in turn will influence their fate and effect on aquatic biota.

On the other hand, the effect of MONPs in the environment is different to their bulk
size or dissolved ion counterparts, because of their high surface-to-volume ratio and surface
characteristics, such as the intensified charge and reactivity [17]. In addition, the ecotoxicity
of MONPs is also determined by further factors including size, oxidative state, exposure
time, particle concentration and the target organism and its habitat [18-21]. As reviewed
by Parada et al. [22], there are numerous nano-ecotoxicological studies on the potential
toxicity of MONPs involving single species aquatic model organisms, such as daphnids,
zebrafish, algae, freshwater bivalve, diatom.
The significance of microbial activity concerning the ecosystem functionality and
services is well established, but microbial diversity of natural waters--especially the effect
of NPs on the biodiversity and structure of the complex aquatic microbial community--
has not been studied extensively. There are some valuable results on this topic based on
various approaches focused on rivers [15,23], a stream [13], marine estuarine sediments [24],
groundwater [25], and three Swedish lakes [11], nevertheless, the effect of nTiO2 and
nZnO on complex aquatic microbial communities needs further investigations and novel
approaches, and Biolog EcoPlate(TM) could be a great tool for this aim.
Battin et al. [13] provided the first evidence that nano-TiO2 significantly impacted natural microbial communities (bacteria stream biofilms) under natural levels of UV radiation
and TiO2 concentrations expected in surface waters. To examine the effect of nano-TiO2 on
the membrane integrity of planktonic microorganisms and biofilm cells in stream water
microcosms, nucleic acid stains and epifluorescence microscopy was used [13].
Farkas et al. [11] conducted the first ecotoxicological study assessing the effect of
nTiO2 on bacterial communities in situ, in three lakes, taking into consideration dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, element concentrations and light regimes. Bacterial
growth after the termination of the exposure period was determined as abundance in the
water samples analysed by flow cytometry. Their results demonstrated that TiO2 NPs
could affect natural lake-water bacterial communities in terms of bacterial abundance and
bacterial activity. The study also showed that nTiO2 significantly affected natural lake
water bacteria and the effects varied among communities from lakes depending on the
chemical parameters of the water.
To study the microbiological impact of zero-valent iron in the remediation of
groundwater exposed to a trichloroethylene-degrading anaerobic microbial community
Zabetakis et al. [25] monitored the changes in total bacterial and archaeal population
numbers using qPCR.
Londono et al. [15] spiked TiO2 at 700 ug/L, ZnO at 70 ug/L either separately or
combined to freshly collected river water samples to investigate effects of engineered
nanoparticles (ENPs) at environmentally relevant concentrations to aquatic microbial
communities. DNA extraction was employed followed by next-generation sequencing to
understand the change of microbial distribution responding to the presence of the ENPs
in river water samples. Species richness (S) was determined by a genera or species taxa
count, while for each treatment the Shannon index (H) for species diversity and species
evenness was calculated. Compared to controls where no ENPs were added, the addition
of TiO2 NPs alone at the tested concentration had no statistically significant effect on both
the bacterial and eukaryotic communities. The presence of added ZnO or ZnO + TiO2 led
to significant shift of the microbial community structure and genus distribution. This shift
was more obvious for the bacteria than the eukaryotes. Based on results from single particle-
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), all ENPs aggregated rapidly
in water and resulted in much larger particles sizes than the original counterparts. The
dissolved (including particles smaller than the size detection limits and dissolved ions)
concentrations of Ti and Zn also increased in the treatment groups vs. the controls [15].
Most of the conducted studies demonstrated that natural aquatic bacterial communities were more sensitive towards individual MONPs than single strains, due to differences
in resistance, highlighting the importance of their investigation [11,15]. Comparing the
effect of nTiO2 on complex bacterial communities with the effect on single species in other

studies, Farkas et al. [11] assumed that in complex bacterial communities the sum of effects
on different strains will determine the overall effect on bacterial abundance and productivity. However, in the case of bacterial communities the factors that are toxic to a subset of
the community might affect negatively the functioning of the overall community, altering
the interaction among the strains [2].
To study microbial diversity in the aquatic environment several biochemical or molecular techniques emerged, as seen in the articles cited above. However, the application of the
Biolog EcoPlate(TM) for studying the MONPs-mediated influences on microbial diversity in
aquatic systems was demonstrated only in a few studies. In spite of this, Biolog EcoPlate(TM)
is a low-cost, convenient and rapid technique for investigating the physiological diversity in the environment and provides information about community-level physiological
profiles (CLPP).
Christian and Lind [26] explored several aspects of Biolog EcoPlate(TM) use for freshwater bacterial assemblages including inoculum density, incubation temperature, nonbacterial colour development, and substrate selectivity and proposed a technique to allow
EcoPlate(TM) use in anaerobic freshwater bacterial studies.
Xie et al. [27] recently explored bacterial diversity, community composition and
metabolic function in Lake Tianmuhu, China, and in its upstream dammed river, using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) method to identify the effects of
anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution discharge and damming on biodiversity.
Even though the above-mentioned studies did apply the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) method
for soil bacterial community analysis, unfortunately, they did not report on some important
parameters, such as the reagents, sample preparation, incubation time, applied dilutions
and precise formulas for calculations. In addition, these studies usually only evaluated a
few Biolog-derived endpoints (usually just AWCD and AUC, sometimes SR) in terms of
biodiversity and microbial community structure. The majority of the conducted microbial
community studies tested ENPs typically higher than 100 mg/L concentrations, and only
some studies reported above 1 mg/L [15].
The objective of our work was the evaluation of the applicability of the Biolog
EcoPlate(TM) technique, a promising tool for community-level physiological profiling, in the
investigation of the concentration- and time-dependent effect of MONPs on the biodiversity
and functionality of freshwater microbial communities.
The research was conducted in lab-scale aquatic microcosms including only water
from Lake Balaton as a model for aquatic surface environments.
We hypothesised that: (i) the metallic NPs (nTiO2 and nZnO) added to Balaton water
would alter the activity and community composition of microbes, (ii) the concentration
of NPs as well as the exposure time would influence their effect, (iii) the applicability of
Biolog EcoPlate(TM) for characterising the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles on freshwater
microbial communities would be demonstrated based on substrate use patterns and that
(iv) the applied Biolog-derived endpoints--characterising both the microbial activity and
diversity--would provide reliable and a wide range of information about the microbial
communities affected by NPs exposure.

2.1. Freshwater Samples from Lake Balaton
Water samples from Lake Balaton, Rvflp, Hungary (46 490 36.500 N 17 370 50.500 E)
were collected in sterile bottles and kept at 4  C for 24 h until the start of the experiments.
For the investigation of the effect of nZnO and nTiO2 the water samples were taken in July

2.2. Characteristics of the Tested Nanomaterials
The examined nanoparticles were purchased from the manufacturers: nano zinc
oxide (nZnO) from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (Budapest, Hungary) (CAS number: 1314-13-2) and
AERODISP(R) VP Disp. W2370X nano titanium dioxide (nTiO2 ) were purchased from Evonik
Resource Efficiency GmbH (Essen, Germany) (CAS number: 13463-67-7). The particle size
of nZnO was less than 100 nm with an average of 40 nm. The mean aggregate size of
nTiO2 was 100 nm and the mean particle diameter by mass was 16 nm. Details and
properties on the NPs were provided by the manufacturers. The NPs were sonicated for
15 min before usage.
2.3. Experimental Setup
Two separate series of experiments--with identical experimental setups--were run in
triplicate to assess the effect of nZnO and nTiO2 in 100 mL microcosms. Samples of 45 mL
Balaton water were transferred into sterile, 100 mL volume Schott-bottles. Then each bottle
was completed to 50 mL with the studied NP suspension at different concentrations aiming
to reach 0.8, 4, 20 and 100 mg/L final NP nominal concentration in each microcosm. The
original NP suspensions were diluted with distilled water. Every treatment had 3 replicates.
Distilled water (DW) was the control. The proportion of DW in the control microcosms
was the same as in the NPs-containing microcosms.
During the experiment samples were shaken at 120 rpm and kept in the dark at room
temperature (22  2  C). For monitoring the effect of NPs, the microcosms were sampled
on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days.
2.4. Monitoring
2.4.1. Physico-Chemical Methods
The pH and electric conductivity of the freshwater samples from Lake Balaton and
the assembled microcosms were determined with a WTW (Wissenschaftlich Technische
Werksttten GmbH, Weilheim in Oberbayern, Germany) instrument using a pH 330 Meter
including a precision Sentix 81 pH Electrode on the initial day and the 3rd, 7th, and 14th
days in three parallels. Electric conductivity (EC) was determined with a Consort C535
instrument (Turnhout, Belgium).
2.4.2. Microbiological Methods
The enzymatic activity of viable cells [28,29] was measured by a tetrazolium reduction
viability assay with ELISA Microplate Reader (Vienna, Austria) for assessing metabolic
activity. Three 200 uL samples were introduced into the wells of a sterile microplate and
the OD was measured at 630 nm.
Then 30 uL of 1 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) was transferred into every well, and the plate was incubated for 15 min in the dark
at room temperature.
The absorbance was measured at 490 nm with DIALAB EL800 Microplate Reader. The
inhibition percentage (I%) compared to control was calculated based on the absorbance
values with the following Equation:
I% =

C-S
*100,
C

(1)

Nanomaterials 2021, 11, 1777

where C is the absorbance of the control and S is the absorbance of the NP containing sample [30].
2.4.3. Biolog EcoPlate(TM)
The Biolog EcoPlate(TM) test method [31] was applied to monitor the effect of zinc oxide
and titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the microbial communities, and how they influence
their substrate use (community-level physiological profiling, CLPP).
The EcoPlate(TM) includes three replicate wells containing 31 organic carbon substrates
and a control well with redox-sensitive tetrazolium dye, but no substrate, for communitylevel physiological profiling (CLPP) of metabolically active heterotrophic bacterial assemblages able to grow in plate conditions [32]. Biolog-derived data for evaluation from CLPP
include: the average well colour development (AWCD) and the Shannon diversity index
(H) [32-34]. AWCD shows the general potential metabolic activity of the microbial community, thus it indicates the total bioactivity of the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) [33]. The Shannon
diversity index (H) informs on the physiological diversity of bacterial communities [33].
Higher values of H indicate metabolically active microbial communities able to degrade
more substrates [34]. Additional Biolog EcoPlate(TM)-derived parameters include substrate
richness (SR) and Shannon evenness (E) [35].
Although the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) methodology does not inform about the genetic composition of the microbial community, it provides valuable insight into bacterial substrate
use patterns and metabolic functional potential in environmental matrices affected by
stressing factors, such as contamination. In addition, it could be applied as a monitoring
method, since it is rapid, low cost, reproducible and simple.
Therefore, this study aims to provide evidence to the applicability of the Biolog
EcoPlate(TM) technique for the characterisation of the microbial activity and biodiversity
of nTiO2 - and nZnO-impacted freshwaters. We compared several endpoints, primarily
those associated with the effects on biodiversity and microbial community structure. The
conventional endpoints, such the AWCD, the substrate richness (SR), the area under the
curve (AUC) and substrate average well colour development (SAWCD) were analysed, but
microbial diversity and its changes triggered by stress factors were in focus. The endpoints
studied and compared in terms of microbial diversity included: Shannon diversity index,
Shannon evenness index, Simpson index, McIntosh index and Gini coefficient.
Measurements were carried out by pipetting 125 uL samples into each well of the
EcoPlate. Plates were incubated in the dark at 25  C, and the absorbance of the wells
was measured every 24 h for 120 h at 490 nm wavelength by DIALAB EL800 Microplate
Reader. Although the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) method usually measures optical density (OD) at
590 nm, because the highest absorbance of the tetrazolium dye could be measured at this
wavelength [31,34,36], our microplate reader was equipped with 405, 450, 490 and 630 nm
filters, and the optimal OD values were provided at 490 nm [37,38].
Because the 96 wells of the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) contain 31 carbon sources and control
wells (blank) in 3 replicates, all measurements were done 3 times, 1-1 series from the
3 replicates of the experimental setup.
The measured absorbance values were corrected before evaluation. Firstly, the OD
values of the control wells (which contain water to read the clear absorption value) were
subtracted from the substrate containing wells OD values. Next, the initial OD value
of each well, measured immediately after pipetting the suspension into the wells, was
subtracted from each OD value corrected in the previous step. The aim was to eliminate
the background effect (the effect of nanoparticles on the optical density values). OD values
measured at 120 h were used for data evaluation because these indicated the optimal
range of OD readings [35,37,39]. Different endpoints were calculated from the corrected
data including average well colour development (AWCD), substrate average well colour
development (SAWCD), substrate richness (SR), Shannon index (H), Shannon evenness (E),
Simpson index (D), McIntosh index (U), and Gini coefficient (G).

Average well colour development (AWCD) was computed by the following equation
for all carbon sources:
N ODi
AWCD = i=1
(2)
N
where ODi is the corrected OD value of each substrate-containing well, while N is the
number of substrates, which in this case is N = 31 [35,38]. For further investigation of the
AWCD, all carbon substrates were classified into six categories based on their characteristics according to Sala et al. [40]: polymers (alpha-cyclodextrin, glycogen, Tween 40, Tween
80), carbohydrates (D-cellobiose, i-erythritol, D-galactonic acid-gamma-lactone, N-acetylD-glucosamine, glucose-1-phosphate, beta-methyl-D-glucoside, D,L-alpha-glycerol phosphate, alpha-D-lactose, D-mannitol, D-xylose), carboxylic acids (gamma-hydroxybutyric
acid, alpha-ketobutyric acid, D-galacturonic acid, D-glucosaminic acid, itaconic acid, Dmalic acid, pyruvic acid methyl ester), amino acids (L-arginine, L-asparagine, glycyl-Lglutamic acid, L-phenylalanine, L-serine, L-threonine), amines (phenylethylamine, putrescine), and phenolic compounds (2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). For
every substrate category the substrate average well colour development (SAWCD) value
was calculated by the following equation:
SAWCD =

N
i=1 ODi
,
N

(3)

where ODi is the corrected OD value of the substrates within the substrate category and N
is the number of substrates in the category [33].
Substrate richness (SR) is the number of oxidised substrates. It was computed as the
total of the cells ODi value which was at least 0.5 after 120 h incubation [41].
The area under the curve (AUC) was computed by the following equation [42]:
N

n

AUC = i=1 j=1

ODin + ODin+1

2 * tin+1 - tin

(4)

where N is the number of substrates, n is the number of measurements, ODi is the corrected
OD value of each individual well, at two consecutive measurements at two different
measurement times for tn and tn + 1 .
Shannon index (H) was calculated according to the following equation:
N

H = -  Pi * ln Pi

(5)

i=1

where N is the number of substrates, Pi is the relative colour development of the well over
the total colour development of each well of a plate [34,43,44].
Pi =

ODi
N
i=1 ODi

(6)

Shannon evenness (E) was derived from the Shannon index by its partition based on
the substrate richness according to Jaowieczki et al. [42]:
E=

H
,
ln(SR)

(7)

where H is the computed Shannon index, while SR is the calculated substrate richness.
Simpson index (D) was computed by the following equation:
N

D = - ln i=1 (Pi )2 ,
where Pi and N are the same as in the Shannon index calculation [45].

McIntosh index (U) was calculated according to Manjunath et al. [46]:
U=

N

(9)

where N is the number of substrates, ODi , is the corrected OD value of each substrate

(10)

where N is the number of substrates, OD is the corrected OD value of each well, AWCD is

2.4.4. Statistical Analysis of Data
Data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using StatSoft(R) Statistica 13.1
(TIBCO Software, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) to calculate if the effect of a treatment was
significant. For this purpose, two types of statistical analyses were done, depending on
the examination.
To investigate the significant differences with respect to enzymatic activity determined
by MTT, one-way ANOVA was used. To verify the criteria for the homogeneity of variances
Cochrans C test was applied.
Repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) was used to investigate the significant
effects of the nZnO and nTiO2 treatments with Biolog EcoPlate(TM) tests. The Mauchley
sphericity test was applied to confirm the criteria.
Both types of statistical analyses were performed at the p < 0.05 significance level.
Fishers Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used for comparison of the effects of
the various treatments. The significant effects are marked with letters on all figures in
alphabetical order, where a is the smallest average value. Columns signed with the same
letter indicate that there was no significant difference between them.
All measured microcosm data were subject to Pearson correlation analysis for detecting
any coherence between the concentration of the applied NPs and diversity indices.
3. Results
3.1. Physico-Chemical Characteristics of Lake Balaton
The pH and electrical conductivity of the water samples did not change significantly
compared to control after 14 days. In the case of the nTiO2 experimental series, the pH was
8.69  0.03 and the EC was 632.0  9.5 uS, while in the nZnO experimental series the pH
was 8.97  0.12 and the EC was 693.8  32.9 uS after 14 days.
3.2. Effect of TiO2 and ZnO Nanoparticles on Enzymatic Activity
The results of the enzymatic activity test based on the tetrazolium reduction viability
assay presented low sensitivity (data not shown).
TiO2 NPs triggered no significant inhibition (<5%), while ZnO NPs exhibited medium
but concentration-dependent inhibition of the enzymatic activity. ZnO at 100 mg/L concentration resulted in the highest inhibition (60  21%), followed by the lower nZnO doses
such as 20 mg/L, 4 mg/L and 0.8 mg/L nZnO, which caused 48  20%, 23  5% and
12  1% inhibition compared to control, respectively.
3.3. Effect of ZnO Nanoparticles on the Community-Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP)
Average well colour development (AWCD) significantly decreased from the start to
the end of the experiment. The different nZnO concentrations had a significant effect on the
AWCD, but the interaction of time and nZnO treatment in different concentrations did not
(Table 2). According to Figure 1, 100 mg/L nZnO had the highest effect (98-99% inhibition),

while 0.8 mg/L nZnO the smallest (11-58%). However, the lowest nZnO concentration
(0.8 mg/L) resulted in a significant decrease compared to the control in the short term
(after 3 days). nZnO had significant impact at 4, 20 and 100 mg/L nZnO concentrations
after 14 days. Correlation analysis (Table S1) indicated strong linear negative association
between ZnO NP concentration and AWCD at each sampling time (r = -0.99).

The area under the curve (AUC) had a similar trend to AWCD (Figure 2), but in this

The correlation analysis (Table S1) displayed a strong significant correlation between the
nZnO concentration and the H values (r = -0.99) only after 3 and 14 days exposure (p < 0.05).
Shannon evenness (E), derived from the Shannon index (H), did not show any significant effects compared to the control at the smallest applied nZnO concentrations (0.8 and
4 mg/L). However, the E value at 20 mg/L nZnO concentration indicated significant effect
(Figure 5). The relevant Equation (7) and the involved SR values for the calculation of E
did not result any E values at 100 mg/L nZnO. According to the RMANOVA statistical
analysis, only the treatment with ZnO nanoparticles had significant effect (Table 2). The
Pearson correlation analysis (Table S1) displayed significant strong correlation between the
nZnO concentration and the E values but only after 7 and 14 days of exposure (r = -0.723
and -0.614 at p < 0.05, respectively).
Based on the Simpson index (D), similarly to the Shannon evenness, ZnO nanoparticles at 0.8 and 4 mg/L concentration had no significant effect compared to the control
(Figure 6). The detectable significant effect occurred only at 20 and 100 mg/L concentrations; the highest decrease (18%) occurred at 100 mg/L nZnO concentration after 14 days.
Although the highest tested concentration caused significant decrease compared to control
at each sampling time, RMANOVA analysis illustrated that the time, treatment and their
interaction had a significant effect on the Simpson index values (Table 2). Correlation
analysis with coefficients r = -0.641 (3rd day), -0.887 (7th day) and -0.849 (14th day)
illustrated significant linear negative relationship between the concentration and Simpson

the low-level but significant effect of nTiO2 , such as enhanced membrane permeability and
subsequent penetration of nanoparticles, in addition to the adsorption of NPs to the cell
membrane which may induce intracellular ROS [13]. Additionally, the binding affinity of
NPs to organic molecules, the penetration of primary particles (<10 nm) through damaged
membranes and matrix effects may induce varying degrees of toxicity [13,50,51].
4.2. Assessment of the Impact of ZnO Nanoparticles on Freshwater Microbial Diversity
In line with studies about the effects of nanomaterials in aquatic and terrestrial systems
performed with different methods we found a concentration- and time-dependent effect of
nZnO on bacterial community [15,49,52].
ZnO nanoparticles significantly and stably inhibited leaf decomposition in stream
water at 100 mg/L throughout a 50-day exposure, as described by Du et al. [53]. Inhibition
occurred only on the 43rd day at 10 mg/L dose of nZnO, but fungal diversity decreased.
According to Du et al. [54], ZnO NPs increased the fungal biomass in aquatic ecosystems
after 5 days of exposure, but after 45 days, chronic effects caused a significant decrease
even at 300 ng/L concentration. Our results were similar to Du et al.s [54] findings, but
the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) technique was already able to identify the negative effects of ZnO
NPs after 3 days exposure at 0.8 mg/L. Both ZnO nanoparticles and the dissolved Zn2+
ions may be responsible for the significant inhibitory effect. In our study, it is unknown
whether dissolved zinc or the ZnO NPs exerted the adverse effects, but this was not the aim
of our research. Our results harmonised with Kusi et al.s [55] about the negative effects of
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on freshwater microbial activity. Kusi et al. [55] applied silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) at 125 mg/L maximum concentration in microcosms with stream
water. The microbial catabolic activity decreased, resulting in a decrease of the AWCD and
SR values. The change in the used carbon source pattern of Kusi et al.s study was similar to
our results regarding the substrate average well colour development (SAWCD), suggesting
amino acids, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids as carbon sources for metabolic fingerprint.
In our research, the most affected substrate group in terms of use, affected by nZnO was the
carboxylic acids group. The substrate average well colour development (SAWCD) ratio by
groups indicated significant and high nZnO-induced changes; use of all substrate groups was
influenced by nZnO especially at the highest concentrations (20-100 mg/L).
The highest shift occurred in the use of carboxylic acids; the initial use (15-17%) in
the control increased to 30-57% at 20 and 100 mg/L nZnO level. This was in accordance
with Teng et al. [56] and Melita et al. [57], who also found that carboxylic acids were
sensitive carbon sources. These substrates are products of organic matter degradation in
surface waters; therefore, carboxylic acids belong to the labile organic matter sources of the
aquatic environment.
The reason for the enhanced carboxylic acid use may be the consumption of easily available substrates stimulated by the degraded environmental conditions at 20 and
100 mg/L nZnO.
4.3. Comparison of the Effects of TiO2 and ZnO Nanoparticles on Freshwater Microbial Diversity
Based on the observed effects of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles, these NPs are harmful for the microbial activity. ZnO NPs had a stronger effect than TiO2 NPs on all the
tested endpoints. In accordance with several studies, our results determined by Biolog
EcoPlate(TM) clearly reflected that the impact of MONPs on microbial community were
largely determined by the type of NP [15,49].
Most of the computed endpoints presented a significant decrease at all examined
concentrations, in some cases there were even detectable significant effects at a dosage of
0.8 mg/L. The influence of ZnO NPs was correlated with exposure time and the applied
concentration; thus, at 100 mg/L dosage, the substrate use activity was highly reduced
after 14 days. These results are similar to the observations of Londono et al. [15], who
found that nZnO had a higher influence on water bacterial community than nTiO2 . In line
with their results, nTiO2 did not cause significant effect at 700 ug/L, while nZnO shifted

the microbial community structure and genus distribution even at 70 ug/L concentration.
Similar to these results, Chavan et al. [49] reported that the metabolic diversity and activity
of microbial communities in soils was impacted in the presence of zinc oxide, but not of
titanium dioxide NPs.
According to the Pearson correlation results, nTiO2 concentration had a low correlation
to the endpoints and most of them were not significant (p < 0.05), but the Pearsons r
values in most cases were higher with the elapsed days (Table S2), which also indicated
the significance of the exposure time. In contrast to the TiO2 nanoparticles, almost every
endpoint (except Shannon evenness) showed a high correlation with the applied nZnO
concentration (|r| > 0.80), and most of them were significant (p < 0.05) (Table S1) regardless
of the exposure time.
The higher damage caused by ZnO NPs to microbial activity may be due to the presence of dissolved zinc ions. Uptake of toxic dissolved zinc ions may result in decreased
enzyme activity as reported by Sirelkhatim et al. [58]. According to their study, ZnO NPs
caused inhibition of the respiratory enzymes [58]. Our findings may reveal this mechanism as well, as the tetrazolium reduction assay in our study displayed a concentrationdependent inhibition of enzyme activity; therefore, the inhibition mechanism may be
similar to that identified by Sirelkhatim et al. [58].
4.4. Characterisation of the Applicability of the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) for the Evaluation of the Effects
of Nanoparticles on Freshwater Microbial Diversity
Biolog EcoPlate(TM) is a low-cost, simple and easy technique to describe and compare
bacterial communities and their activity. It provides information through different calculated endpoints derived from the optical density values. Because the examined nTiO2
concentrations proved to have significant effects only in some cases, the conclusions of our
study focused mainly on the effect of nZnO. Based on our results, the AWCD, AUC and SR
values significantly decreased with incremental ZnO NPs concentrations. These endpoints
demonstrate the harmful effects of nZnO, but they are not completely independent from
each other.
SR and AWCD interact with each other: a high AWCD value indicates use of many
carbon sources, a medium AWCD value suggests that all substrates are slightly used
or some carbon sources are well used and the others are not used [59]. AUC values
are also calculated based on ODs, and thus the AUC has a similar pattern to AWCD
and SR. RMANOVA analysis revealed significant changes in the metabolic profiles of
the microbial community according to the above-mentioned indices and in the presence
of ZnO nanoparticles, but significant differences were more pronounced for AUC and
SR parameters.
The use rates of different substrate classes (SAWCD) have rarely been applied in Biolog
EcoPlate(TM) studies, although they can provide important and complementary information
to the frequently applied endpoints. Substrates which are promptly and preferentially used
may indicate important information on the environmental conditions [57]. Interestingly,
the use of carboxylic acids showed an increasing trend over time at concentrations of 20
and 100 mg/L nZnO. The use of pyruvic acid methyl ester was the most significant within
the carboxylic acid group at these nanomaterial concentrations after 14 days. The use of
Tween40 and Tween80 was also significant in the microcosms containing high (20 and
100 mg/L) nZnO concentrations, while the carbohydrates were used at a much lower rate
than in the control. Presumably, in this impacted environment, microorganisms acquired
the ability to metabolise more complex carbon sources.
Our research aimed at the comparative evaluation of the different diversity indicators
such as Shannon index, Shannon evenness, Simpson index, McIntosh index and Gini
coefficient. Among these, the Shannon index and Shannon uniformity are most commonly
used for the estimation of functional diversity.
Shannon index provides information about the distribution of the used carbon sources.
A high Shannon index implies a greater functional metabolic diversity and at the same time
an even distribution of different functional types. A great evenness can only be obtained

if all carbon sources are well used, but it does not work backwards. If the majority of the
substrates are used, the Shannon index value will be high [59]. Based on our results, nZnO
treatment decreased the values of the Shannon index. This proves the negative effects of
ZnO nanoparticles on microbial activity and diversity. Shannon evenness (E) is a measure
of the uniformity of metabolic activities across all substrates. Shannon evenness had lower
values below 20 mg/L nZnO concentration, while at 100 mg/L there were mathematical
problems, because the SR value was 0, and the equation of this index (7) contains a division
with natural logarithm of SR, hence there was a decrease, and thus it is not recommended
to use this endpoint for characterisation.
Simpson index, similarly to the Shannon indices, represented the negative effects
of nZnO. The rare species are rather more weighted in the Shannon than the common
species, so the Shannon index is strongly influenced by species richness. The Simpson
index weights common species more than relatively rare species, so this index gives more
weight to evenness [60]. In our research, there was no significant difference between the
two indices.
According to our results, McIntosh index is the best way to represent the change of
the AWCD, AUC and SR endpoints; hence, the calculation of this index was based on the
measured OD values, just like AWCD, AUC and SR. The McIntosh index is another measure
of dominance; however, this index is not widely used. In our study, the McIntosh index
value correlated with the microbial activity, and it also indicated the effect of treatment and
time. Dejong [61] also found that the McIntosh and Simpson indices were more suitable to
measure diversity than the Shannon index, because these indices were influenced noticeably
more by evenness and less by richness than the Shannon index.
It should be highlighted that due to the sensitivity of the Gini coefficient, it reflected
well the changes in metabolic activity triggered by the presence of NPs (nano titanium
dioxide in addition to zinc oxide) (Figure S3). Gini index values increased with incremental
ZnO NP concentrations, although the RMANOVA analysis did not display such a strong
significant difference than in the case of the Shannon, Simpson and McIntosh index.
The Biolog EcoPlate(TM) technique does, however, have some limitations [32,49]. Using
Biolog EcoPlate(TM) for bacterial community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) is easier and
cheaper than DNA or RNA-based profiling. Additionally, several studies have reported
that molecular profiling surveys are not more sensitive than CLPP approaches [62,63].
Nevertheless, further research is needed to estimate which bacterial genera are the most
affected by NPs, because significantly different patterns can be observed by CLPP and DNAbased methods [64,65]. Changes of the aerobic and anaerobic microbial community should
also be investigated, which could be performed by Biolog AN (anaerobic) microplate,
provided with 95 carbon sources; hence, the use of more substrates could be examined.
5. Conclusions
Metal oxide nanoparticles are commonly and extensively used; therefore, they are
likely to end up in aquatic environments. Nonetheless, their effect on freshwater microbial
diversity has been poorly described. In this research, the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) technique
was applied, based on living microorganisms, to show the metabolic capabilities and
the physiological profiles of microbial community in MONPs affected freshwater. By
experimenting with TiO2 and ZnO NPs in freshwater lab-scale microcosms, it was shown
that nTiO2 weakly influences microbial community, while ZnO nanoparticles have a strong
effect on the metabolic activity and functional diversity of the microbiome. Not just the
presence and concentration of MONPs, but the exposure time also exhibited a significant
effect on the studied Biolog EcoPlate(TM) parameters. The Biolog EcoPlate(TM) data clearly
reflected that the changes were largely determined by the type of NP. Carbohydrates,
carboxylic acids and polymers were found to be the principal indicator substrates at higher
ZnO nanoparticle concentrations. Our results also demonstrated that the sensitivities of the
examined indices were different and their simultaneous use could provide complementary
information. McIntosh index as a diversity indicator displayed a good sensitivity for

indicating the modified diversity of a bacterial community in nanomaterials affected
freshwater. The evenness of microbial species and their carbon source use evenness also
changed upon NP treatment, which was indicated by the Gini coefficient and Shannon
evenness. To indicate the effect of nanoparticles on microbial communities the application
of the Biolog EcoPlate(TM) as a rapid, cheap and practical technique is recommended.
