# Summary: Biolog EcoPlate Technique for Nanoparticle Effects on Freshwater Communities

- Peer-reviewed study (Nanomaterials 2021) evaluates EcoPlate (TM) for assessing metal oxide nanoparticle effects on freshwater microbial communities.
- Microcosm experiments exposed lake water to nano TiO2 and nano ZnO across 0.8-100 mg/L; endpoints included AWCD, AUC, substrate richness, and diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, McIntosh, Gini).
- Results show TiO2 had relatively low impact (up to ~30% inhibition), while ZnO caused strong, concentration-dependent inhibition (up to ~99%).
- Exposure time mattered; substrate use patterns indicated carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and polymers as key indicators at higher ZnO levels.
- Conclusion: EcoPlate is a rapid, low-cost CLPP method; McIntosh and Gini indices were especially sensitive, and multiple indices should be used together.
