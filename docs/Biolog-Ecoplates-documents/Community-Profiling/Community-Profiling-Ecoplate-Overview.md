# Community Profiling Ecoplate Overview

Biolog for Community Profiling

Biolog Solutions
for Ecological Insights
EcoPlates(TM) provide a sensitive and reliable
index of environmental change. This approach,
called community-level physiological profiling (CLPP),
effectively distinguishes spatial and temporal
changes in the metabolism of microbial communities.
31 carbon assays in triplicate
EcoPlates contain 3 repeated
sets of 31 carbon sources and
employ a tetrazolium redox
dye as an indicator of microbial
metabolism. As microbes utilize
the carbon sources they respire
and the tetrazolium reporter dye
is reduced to form a visible color.
Communities of microorganisms
will exhibit a characteristic
reaction pattern, a metabolic
fingerprint, that reflects the
metabolic properties of
the community.

EcoPlates can be used in many applications including:

Analyzing population
changes in soil

Water and wastewater
profiling

Activated sludge, compost
& industrial waste testing

Monitoring bioremediation
and effects of toxic
chemicals

Key Applications:

- Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP)
- Monitoring temporal or spatial changes in
microbial community activity

- Observing changes before and after
perturbation

- Metabolic community fingerprinting
- Screening community diversity / similarity
- Assaying Carbon Source Utilization Patterns
(CSUP)

- Monitoring changes in community functional
diversity

Typical Procedure:
STEP 1: Environmental samples (as aqueous
samples or after suspension) are diluted to a
standard cell density and then pipetted directly
into EcoPlates.
STEP 2: EcoPlates are incubated and the metabolic
pattern formation of the community is recorded
kinetically.
STEP 3: The community-level physiological profile
is assessed for key characteristics such as pattern
stability (similarity), rate of color change in each well
(activity), and richness of well response (diversity).

EcoPlate Data Collection:
In applied ecological research, EcoPlates are
used as both an assay of the stability of a normal
population and to detect and assess changes
following the onset of an environmental variable.
The utility of using Biolog technology to analyze
microbial communities has been documented
in over 500 publications. Visit our bibliography

Catalog #1506 - EcoPlate (box of 10)

EcoPlates should be read kinetically to capture
the profile of substrate metabolism. This can
be accomplished with repeated reading of
microplates using a microplate reader such as
the MicroStation(TM). A better option, especially
when many samples are being analyzed, is the
fully-automated Odin(R) incubator/reader
which automatically reads up to 50 EcoPlates
every 15 minutes. The MicroStation and Odin
come with software that records all data and
facilitates analysis.
