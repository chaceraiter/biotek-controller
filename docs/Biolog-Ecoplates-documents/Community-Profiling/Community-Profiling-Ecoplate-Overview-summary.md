# Summary: Community Profiling Ecoplate Overview

- EcoPlate (TM) supports community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) using 31 carbon sources in triplicate with a tetrazolium dye readout.
- Microbial respiration reduces the dye to a visible color, producing a metabolic fingerprint of the community.
- Typical uses include soil and water profiling, wastewater and sludge testing, and bioremediation monitoring.
- Procedure: dilute samples to a standard cell density, inoculate, incubate, and read plates kinetically to assess pattern stability, activity, and diversity.
- Kinetic reads can be done with a MicroStation (TM) or Odin (R) incubator/reader; catalog reference is EcoPlate 1506 (10/box).
