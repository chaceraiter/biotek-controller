# Summary: Microbial Community Analysis EcoPlate

- EcoPlate (TM) is a 96-well plate with 31 carbon sources in triplicate plus controls, designed for community-level physiological profiling (CLPP).
- Community metabolic fingerprints are derived from kinetic color development as tetrazolium dye is reduced during respiration.
- Recommended analysis uses kinetic reads over 2-5 days; common metrics include average well color development (AWCD), activity (rate), and richness (diversity).
- Typical workflow: inoculate environmental samples, incubate, collect kinetic data, and analyze patterns with statistics such as PCA.
- The document includes a complete well map and references; EcoPlate catalog number is 1506 (10/box).
