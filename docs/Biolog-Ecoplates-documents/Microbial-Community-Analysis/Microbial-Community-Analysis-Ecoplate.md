FIGURE 1. Carbon Sources in EcoPlate

INTRODUCTION
Microbial communities provide useful information about
environmental change. Microorganisms are present in virtually
all environments and are typically the first organisms to react
to chemical and physical changes in the environment. Because
they are near the bottom of the food chain, changes in microbial
communities are often a precursor to changes in the health and
viability of the environment as a whole.
The Biolog EcoPlate(TM) (Figure 1) was created specifically for
community analysis and microbial ecological studies. It was
originally designed at the request of a group of microbial
ecologists that wanted a panel that provided replicate sets of
tests1.
Community analysis using Biolog microplates was originally
described in 1991 by J. Garland and A. Mills2. They and
other researchers found that by inoculating a mixed
population of microorganisms and measuring the community

metabolism over time, they could ascertain characteristics
of that community. This approach, called community-level
physiological profiling, or CLPP, has been demonstrated to
be effective at distinguishing spatial and temporal changes in
microbial communities. In applied ecological research EcoPlates
are used as both an assay of the stability of a normal population
and to detect and assess changes following the onset of an
environmental variable.
Studies have been done in diverse applications of microbial
ecology and have demonstrated the fundamental utility of
EcoPlates in detecting population changes in soil, water,
wastewater, activated sludge, compost, and industrial waste.
The utility of the information has been documented in hundreds
of publications using Biolog technology to analyze microbial
communities. A bibliography of publications is posted on
the Biolog website at www.biolog.com/support/publicationdatabase.

Microbial Community Analysis
ECOPLATE
The EcoPlate contains 31 carbon sources that are useful for
community analysis. These 31 carbon sources are repeated
3 times to provide more data replicates. Communities of
microorganisms will give a characteristic reaction pattern
called a metabolic fingerprint. From a single EcoPlate, these
fingerprint reaction patterns rapidly and easily characterize
the community.

The community reaction patterns are typically analyzed at
defined time intervals over 2 to 5 days. The changes in the
pattern are compared and analyzed using statistical analysis
software. The most popular method of analysis of the data is
via Principle Components Analysis (PCA) of average well color
development (AWCD) data, but alternative methods may also
offer advantages3-11. The changes observed in the fingerprint
pattern provide useful data about the microbial population
changes over time.

TYPICAL PROCEDURE3
STEP 1: Environmental samples are inoculated directly into
EcoPlates either as aqueous samples or after suspension (soil,
sludge, sediment, etc.).
STEP 2: The EcoPlates are incubated and kinetic data collected
and analyzed.
STEP 3: The community-level physiological profile is assessed
for key characteristics:
o

Pattern development (similarity)

o

Rate of color change in each well (activity)

o

Richness of well response (diversity)

Formation of purple color occurs when the microbes can utilize
the carbon source and begin to respire. The respiration of
the cells in the community reduces a tetrazolium dye that is
included with the carbon source.

The reaction patterns are most effectively analyzed using
an Odin(TM) system for Phenotype Characterization. Odin can
incubate and read up to 50 plates at once, and automatically
generates kinetic analyses for each condition.
Statistical analysis of the data is typically performed using
standard software packages. Some researchers have found
that PCA provides greater resolution than other methods of
statistical analysis11.
