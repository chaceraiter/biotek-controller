Appendix B B-7
Controlling the Reader Using Serial Protocol
At baud rates of 1200, 2400, and 9600, the ELx808TM is capable of sending and receiving data
through its serial port (RS-232C). The baud rate used for transmission is held in non-volatile
memory and can be changed by the user. Other serial port parameters, Parity (None), Data Bits
(8), and Stop Bits (2) are fixed and cannot be changed.
The reader’s RS-232C serial port is configured as a DTE; that is, the unit is wired to resemble a
modem. Data is received on Pin 3 (the RX Pin), and transmitted on Pin 2 (the TX pin).
See Chapter 2, Set Up the Serial Port for Communications with Other Devices.

B-8 Computer Control
Computer Control Command Set
A command from the computer to the reader consists of a single ASCII character, and in some
cases, subsequent argument data. Upon receipt of a valid command character, the reader returns
an <ACK> character. Some commands also return response data to the host computer. Upon
completion of command processing, the ELx808 transmits a status string to the computer. When
the reader sends data to the computer, the data is sent first, then the status string.
While awaiting a command, the ELx808 responds to nulls or other unexpected characters by
clearing its input buffer and transmitting a <NAK>. Therefore, if valid commands are preceded
by invalid characters, they may be missed.
Refer to Table B-2 for the ASCII Control Characters used in the computer control protocol.
All ASCII character strings representing numbers or names are transmitted most significant digit
or letter first. Data values not indicated as ASCII are treated as binary integers, and are
transmitted least significant byte first.
Some commands described here may not be available with older reader basecode versions (prior
to v3.00), indicated if the Check Feature command returns a <NAK>. These commands are
marked with a ‘#’.

B-10 Computer Control
reader response protocol:
initial status string (5)
for each kinetic interval (one if endpoint read):
for each wavelength:
data start code (1) <CR>
for each of eight wells:
comma separator (1) ','
sign (1) '+' or '-'
data (4) “1234”
row terminator (2) <CR>, <LF>
temperature (3) ***(if specified) “000” – “999”
wavelength terminator (1) <^Z>
checksum (1) 0 - 255
final terminator (1) <^Z>
final status string (5) (ELx status mode only)
*** Temperature response included only if requested. Format is three ASCII bytes scaled up by
ten, i.e. “275”correponds to 27.5 degrees C. See the Include Temperature Response command.
Data is returned in the order wells are specified. If fewer than eight wells are to be read, each
well’s unused row and column must be replaced with “00”. Data is always returned for eight
wells, regardless of the actual number specified.
See the Read Plate command for details concerning results data format, and error handling and
status string information. This command always returns data using the ELx format.

# GET BASECODE VERSION (‘e’)
This command returns a string containing the part number and version number for the instrument
downloadable basecode software.

host: valid limits: response:
‘e’ no arguments <ACK/NAK>
reader response protocol:
part number (7) “0000000” – “9999999”
intermediate string (10) “ Version “
version code (7) “x.xxyyy”
status string (5)
The version number is indicated by the first four characters of the version code (x.xx). The
remaining characters in the version code (yyy) may either be blank or represent a specific beta or
prototype release code.

Appendix B B-11
# INCLUDE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE (‘i’)
This command causes the current temperature to be included in the results response for each plate
read using the ‘S’, ‘c’, or ‘d’ commands.

host: valid limits: response:
‘i’ <ACK/NAK>
data bytes: inclusion

‘0’: no temperature with plate data
‘1’: include temperature with plate data

By default the instrument is initialized to not include a temperature response, and automatically
reverts to this default when a new assay definition table is loaded, either from the front panel or
by computer control.

PRESENT PLATE CARRIER (‘J’)
This command causes the plate carrier to move back outside the instrument where it can be
loaded with a microplate.

host: valid limits: response:
‘J’ no arguments <ACK>
status string (5)
SET READ MODE (‘k’)
This command selects the read mode controlling the speed, accuracy, and precision of all
subsequent plate reads.

host: valid limits: response:
‘k’ no arguments <ACK>
data bytes: mode

‘0’: slow (enhanced) mode
‘1’: fast mode

status string (5)

B-12 Computer Control
SET STATUS FORMAT (‘n’)
This command selects the format for the status string (see Status String Format).
host: valid limits: response:
‘n’ no arguments <ACK>
data bytes: format

‘0’: 312 status mode
‘1’: ELx status mode

status string (5)
When the status format is set to ELx status mode, any error detected during the execution of any
command described in this document will be transmitted to the host PC in this format; in
addition, plate read and scan commands (‘d’ and ‘S’) shall return an additional status string at the
very end of the read sequence. See Status String Format for error descriptions.

GET CURRENT STATUS (‘o’)
This command returns the most recent error status set by the instrument. In the event of a reader
timeout or <DLE> receipt, it can be used to determine the error code associated with the reader
failure. It can also be used in place of pressing a key on the reader to stop the beeping after an
error. The status is always returned in the ELx status format.

host: valid limits: response:
‘o’ no arguments <ACK>
status string (5)
Requesting the current status through the use of this command will cause the status maintained
on-board the instrument to be cleared except in the following situations:
1. A fatal error has been detected. The only way to clear this type of error is by recycling
power on the instrument.
2. An error has been detected which requires a self-test to be executed before a read
operation can be performed. In this case, only a successful self-test will cause the error to
be cleared.
This command is most useful when invoked in pairs. The first try will yield the most recent error
detected (or no error), which will then be cleared by the reader if possible. The next call will then

yield either no error, or a previously-detected error that still needs to be cleared by running a self-
test. Commands other than read commands may always be sent regardless of the current reader

status; if there is a hardware issue preventing successful execution, a subsequent error status will
be generated.
See Status String Format for error descriptions.

Appendix B B-13
SET QUIET MODE (‘q’)
This command allows the user to select a “quiet” mode. When this mode is turned on, the reader
bypasses the process of displaying an error code and beeping until a key is pressed. As long as
the quiet mode is selected, errors detected while processing serial-control commands are available
only if ELx Status Mode is selected, or in response to the Get Current Status (‘o’) command.
Serial-only instruments are set to quiet mode automatically at powerup.

host: valid limits: response:
‘q’ no arguments <ACK>
data bytes: mode
‘0’: off
‘1’: on (quiet)

status string (5)
READ PLATE (‘S’)
This command causes a microplate to be read according to the currently loaded assay definition
table.

host: valid limits: response:
‘S’ no arguments <ACK/NAK>
reader response protocol:
status string (5)
for each kinetic interval (one if endpoint read):
for each wavelength expected: (312 format: one, ELx format: up to three)
wavelength start code (1) <CR>
for each row within specified row range:
for each column (well) within specified column range:
comma separator (1) ','
sign (1) '+' or '-'
data (4) “1234”
row terminator (2) <CR>, <LF>
temperature (3) ***(if specified) “000” – “999”
assay name (8 ) (312 format only) “ABCDEF”, <CR>, <LF>
unused extra characters (49) (312 format only)
wavelength terminator (1) <^Z>
checksum (1) (ELx format only) 0 - 255
final terminator (1) (ELx format only) <^Z>
final status string (5) (ELx status mode only)

B-14 Computer Control
*** Temperature response included only if requested. Format is three ASCII bytes scaled up by
ten, i.e. “275”correponds to 27.5 degrees C. See the Include Temperature Response command.
Absorbance data is returned in the form of a 5-character ASCII string, with a sign character
followed by four digits. A decimal point is not included, but should be inserted by the user after
the first digit, i.e. “+1234” should be translated as +1.234 OD. Overrange readings are indicated
by the 5-character string “*****” instead of a signed numerical value.
If dual-wavelength subtraction has been selected in the reader definition table, the subtraction is
performed by the reader and the result is sent as a single plate representing the difference in ODs
per well. Otherwise a complete plate of ODs is sent for each wavelength selected.
If an error is detected during a plate read, or the user aborts the process via serial ‘X’ or stop key
press, the entire (remaining) data response is replaced by a single <DLE> character (0x10). In the
ELx Status Mode, the final status string then indicates the error detected. In the case of reader
error, data previously received during the current read sequence should be discarded.
312 Format:
This format is selected by default at reader powerup, and every time a new assay definition is
loaded, either via serial control ‘V’ command, or by the user from the front panel. The reader
always returns data as an 8 x 12 matrix, along with the assay name and extra characters. There
are no checksums or final terminator.
ELx Format:
If any of the following occurs, the ELx format is selected and remains enabled until a new
definition is loaded, either via serial control ‘V’ command, or by the user from the front panel:
1. Multi-wavelength mode is selected in the assay definition
2. A range of rows is set, even if for all rows (see Set Row Range).
3. A range of columns is set, even if for all columns (see Set Column Range).
The reader returns data in a matrix corresponding to the rows and columns selected, for up to
three wavelengths. If dual-wavelength subtraction is selected, only one plate shall be returned
(not available in the multi-wavelength mode).
Checksum calculation starts with the first byte AFTER the wavelength start code, up through and
including the <^Z> data terminator code at the end of each wavelength’s plate data. The
checksum is transmitted as an integer data byte (not ASCII).
The final terminator indicates that the data stream is complete for the corresponding Read Plate
command. No more data shall be transmitted until another command is sent.

Appendix B B-15
312 Status Format:
If the middle character in the status string is not ASCII ‘0’, an error has been detected and no
results data is transmitted.
ELx Status Format:
If any character in the initial status string is not ASCII ‘0’, an error has been detected and no
results data is transmitted. Otherwise, if an error is detected during the read process, the final
status string reflects that error.
See Status String Format for error descriptions.

SET ASSAY DEFINITION (‘V’)
This command downloads to the reader an assay definition table to be used in subsequent plate
reads or wellset reads (‘S’ or ‘d’ commands) until a new definition replaces it, either via serial
control or by the user from the front panel.

168 delay before first read (0: no, 1: yes)
169 - 170 delay (seconds, 0 - 999)
status string (5)
The multi-wavelength mode returns a plate of data for each wavelength specified. To select the
multi-wavelength mode, the “measurement wavelength” must be set to “000”, and wavelengths
specified starting with “first wavelength”. Up to three wavelengths may be specified in this
mode. However, if dual-wavelength subtraction is desired, the measurement and reference
wavelengths must be specified. A single-wavelength read may use either mode.
If a wavelength is not to be used, it must be replaced by “000”.
If the multi-wavelength mode is selected, the ELx format for data response will be used until a
new assay definition table is specified.
A kinetic interval of zero will cause the plate to be read repeatedly with no pauses between reads.
The assay definition table must be downloaded before other plate-specific commands are sent,
such as Set Row Range and Set Column Range.
To minimize confusion, all “don’t cares” should be set to 0.

GET WAVELENGTH TABLE (‘W’)
This command uploads the wavelength setup table from the reader.

host: valid limits: response:
‘W’ no arguments <ACK/NAK>
reader response protocol:
for each wavelength configured (six):
wavelength (“000 - “900”)
comma terminator ‘,’
status string (5)

Appendix B B-17
HALT (‘X’)
This command causes any read in progress to be halted.

host: valid limits: response:
‘X’ no arguments none (see below)
The following events occur when this command is invoked:
1. The read process is halted, and all axes are returned to their home positions (the plate is
moved back outside where it can be accessed).
2. The reader transmits a <DLE> character to the computer when the above process is
completed.
3. No more data is transmitted by the read or scan in progress. A final status string is
transmitted in the ELx Status Mode.

# SET ROW RANGE (‘r’)
This command selects a range of adjacent rows (lettered on plate or strip carrier) to be read.

host: valid limits: response:
‘%’ <ACK/NAK>
data bytes:
1 first row (1 - 16)
2 last row (1 - 16)
status string (5)
By default the instrument is initialized to perform full plate reads, and automatically reverts to
this default when a new assay definition table is loaded, either from the front panel or by
computer control.
Once this command is invoked, the reader will use the ELx format for data response until a new
assay definition table is specified.
This command has no effect on the read parameters for a wellset read.

B-18 Computer Control
# SET COLUMN RANGE (‘%’)
This command selects a range of adjacent columns (numbered on plate or strip carrier) to be read.

host: valid limits: response:
‘%’ <ACK/NAK>
data bytes:
1 first column (1 - 24)
2 last column (1 - 24)
status string (5)
By default the instrument is initialized to perform full plate reads, and automatically reverts to
this default when a new assay definition table is loaded, either from the front panel or by
computer control. The well range is also reset when the Set Geometry command is sent.
Once this command is invoked, the reader will use the ELx format for data response until a new
assay definition table is specified.
This command has no effect on the read parameters for a wellset read.

# GET MINIMUM KINETIC INTERVAL (‘$’)
This command provides a means for the user to determine the minimum kinetic read interval, as
dictated by the current assay definition table, well range, and even baud rate selected.

host: valid limits response:
'$' no arguments <ACK/NAK>
kinetic interval (2)
status string (5)
The reader returns the minimum kinetic interval as a 2-byte integer value (not ASCII, so low byte
first).
Minimum kinetic intervals are not available for wellset reads.

Appendix B B-19
SELF-TEST (‘*’)
This command causes the reader to perform a system self-test and calibration. This should be
performed any time the wavelength configuration is changed (‘M’ command).

host: valid limits: response:
'*' no arguments <ACK/NAK>
data stream
status string (5)
The reader responds by sending a variable-sized stream of ASCII character data representing
various calibration and test results. This data stream is followed by the standard status response
string.

SET TEMPERATURE (‘[’)
This command sets the incubation chamber temperature setpoint.

host: valid limits: response:
'[' <ACK/NAK>
data bytes:
1 - 2 temperature setpoint (0, 22 - 50)

status string (5)

If the instrument is not equipped with a working incubator, or if the indicated temperature
setpoint is out of range, an incubator setpoint error will be returned with the standard status
response string. A setpoint of zero will turn the incubator heaters off.

B-20 Computer Control
GET TEMPERATURE (‘]’)
This command returns the current temperature in the incubation chamber.

host: valid limits response:
']' no arguments <ACK/NAK>
temperature (2)
status string (5)
The reader returns the current temperature as a 2-byte integer value (not ASCII, so low byte first).
Temperature is returned scaled up by 10, i.e. 370 indicates a temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures below the instrument minimum of 18 degrees are returned as 111 (0x006F);
temperatures above the instrument maximum of 55 degrees are returned as 999 (0x03E7).
If the instrument does not have incubation, or an incubation error has been detected, 0x0000 will
be returned as temperature data. An incubator temperature error will then be flagged and returned
with the standard status response string. Otherwise, the current temperature (averaged over four
thermal zones) is returned as defined above.
The reader will accept and process the Get Temperature command at any time, including during a
read cycle. The temperature response will NOT interrupt a plate data response stream, however.
If a Get Temperature command is received during a data transmission, it will not be processed
until the transmission has completed, i.e. after the <^Z> checksum combination has been sent.

GET PLATE BARCODE (‘s’)
This command returns the barcode for the microplate currently in the instrument carrier.

host: valid limits response:
's' no arguments <ACK/NAK>
barcode (32)
status string (5)
The barcode is returned as a stream of 32 characters. If the barcode itself is less than 32
characters it is padded with nulls (0x00) up through the 32nd character. Otherwise the barcode is
truncated to 32 characters and sent with no null terminator.
If no barcode is detected after two passes of the microplate carrier in front of the scanner, the
null-terminated string “NR” is returned, followed by the remaining 29 nulls. A barcode error is
flagged and returned with the standard status response string.

If the ‘z’ command is not recognized (indicated by a NAK response to the ‘z’), it means the
instrument basecode version was released prior to implementation of this command (along with
the other commands marked as such with a ‘#’). In this case, if the feature is marked in the table
above as “legacy”, the indicated commands and functions are and always have been available
anyway.

Appendix B B-23
Using the Stop Key to Halt Plate Reads
Pressing the STOP key on the reader while a computer-control-initiated plate read is in progress
causes the following to occur.
1. The read process is halted, and all axes are returned to their home positions (the plate is
moved back outside where it can be accessed).
2. The reader transmits a <DLE> character to the computer when the above process is
completed.
3. No more data is transmitted by the read in progress. A final status string is transmitted in
the ELx Status Mode.

B-24 Computer Control
Status String Format
Following execution of each command (except as noted), the ELx808 sends a status string back to
the computer.
312 Status Mode Format:
This status string consists of 5 successive ASCII characters -- RS, S1, S2, S3, and ETX:
⇒ RS A record separator that marks the beginning of the status string.
⇒ S1 Always ASCII zero (‘0’)
⇒ S2 A single digit, used as a reader fault or error code number.

ERROR CODES

Error codes indicate the following:
‘0’: no fault or error
‘8’: instrument failure - perform self-test
‘9’: error in assay, scan, or table definition
‘A’: error in well range selection
‘B’: incubator setpoint error
‘C’: incubator temperature error
‘E’: barcode error
⇒ S3 Always ASCII zero (‘0’)
⇒ ETX End Of Text -- marks the end of the status block.
Instrument failures are usually accompanied by an error code on the reader display
ELx Status Mode Format:
This status string consists of 5 successive ASCII characters – a four-byte string representing a
hexadecimal status code, and then ETX.
Items described in angle brackets (<>) are indicated by an ASCII digit replacing the last ‘0’
character in the status code.
Items described in curly braces ({}) are indicated by an ASCII digit replacing the next-to-last ‘0’
character in the status code.

Appendix B B-25
Fatal errors indicate a hardware failure, also shown on the instrument display screen, and require
recycling of instrument power.
Note – Errors listed below are common to all reader instruments, and may not all be applicable to
any single given reader.
