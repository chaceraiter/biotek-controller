# BioTek ELx808 — Computer Control Notes (Appendix B Excerpt)

Source: user-provided excerpt from Appendix B (computer control) of an ELx808 manual.

## Capabilities / behavior under computer control
- Supports defining and running computer-controlled **kinetic assays** using up to **three wavelengths** on the same microplate.
- When computer control is used:
  - the ELx808’s **onboard blanking** is suppressed
  - the ELx808’s **data reduction calculations** are suppressed
  - **raw data** is returned to the controlling software for evaluation
  - readings **higher than 3.000 OD** may be transmitted

## Software mentioned
- Bio-Tek **KCjunior** and **KC4** are referenced as controlling software packages at the time of the manual.
- User notes newer software ecosystem appears to be Agilent **Gen5** (not yet validated in-project).

## Next artifact needed
- The actual Appendix B protocol definition and command set pages (framing, checksums, request/response formats, error/status codes).
